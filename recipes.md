## Double crust fudge bars

### Ingredients
| **Shortbread**           |
|--------------------------|
| 2 cups all-purpose flour |
| 1/2 cup sugar            |
| 1 cup vegan margarine    |
| 1/2 teaspoon salt        |

| **Filling**                 |
|-----------------------------|
| 3/4 cup canned coconut milk |
| 1/4 cup sugar               |
| 2 cups chocolate chips      |
| 1/2 cup chopped walnuts     |

### Making
*To make the shortbread:* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a pan and line with parchment paper long enough to overhand the edges.

In a food processor, pulse lour, margarine, sugar and salt until crumbly. Reserve 1 cup of dough for tipping, and press the remaining dough into the prepared pan.

*To make the filling:* In a medium saucepan, combine coconut milk, chocolate chips, and sugar. Stir over low heat until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and stir in nuts.

*To make the bars:* Pour the filling over the unbaked crust and crumble the reserved shortbread dough over the top, leaving some of the dough in larger clumps.

Bake for 35 minutes. Let cool, the chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. Once chilled and set, lift the parchment paper to release the bars from the pan and unmold. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares, and serve.

*Note:* The cookies will need to chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight before serving.
